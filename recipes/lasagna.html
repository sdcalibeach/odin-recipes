    <ul> Ingredients
        <li>15oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup parmessan cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 finely diced yellow onion</li>
        <li>3/4 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>3/4 pound ground Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3 minced garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>40oz mariana sauce in jar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups mozarella cheese</li>


        
    </ul>
    <ol>
        Steps
        <li>Combine the cheese filling ingredients in a medium bowl and set aside. 
            Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil over medium heat and add the diced onions.
             Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar 
            which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef and sausage and increase heat to medium-high. 
            Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. 
            Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. 
            Add garlic during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom 
            and sides of the pot. Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, 
            and Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. 
            Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
        <li>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water for the lasagna noodles. 
            Once a rapid boil is reached, 
            cook the noodles to al dente according to package instructions.
            Drain and rinse with cold water until noodles are completely cool. </li>
        <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment 
            paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. 
            Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, 
            followed by about 1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</li>   
        <li>Top with 4 more lasagna noodles, 
            1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce.</li>   
        <li>Finish with 4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture,
             and the rest of the meat sauce.</li>   
        <li>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</li> 
        <li>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray and place it spray-side-down on
             top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li> 
        <li>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove cover and bake for 10 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to 
            serving to allow the layers to set. Serve with garlic bread with cheese.</li>               
    </ol>
